Small single page app that focuses on equality, sharing and spreading ideas about it.

Team designed and broke apart app into small pieces. After each member worked on their piece, we brought them all together into Cloud9.

Cloud9 issues: general use, jquery issues. CSS issues, mostly with positioning. Stepping on each others code.

New javascript like variables and if's. How to work together as a team. How to divide the work apart and bring it all together. 

Finish the functionality, and make visual improvements.
